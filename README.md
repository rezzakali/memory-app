Hi Coders!
In this project I'm trying to make a memory app using React.js, I try to make it best.
In this project I'm getting the a big problem when i'm trying to check the prevCardIndex index and compare to it the current Card index, but after a few minutes later I'm able to find out the problem and fix it. And finally complete the project with confidently.

Thanks
